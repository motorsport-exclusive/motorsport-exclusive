    <div class="article-title">⚠️ Antonelli’s Rough Start in Bahrain FP1</div>
    <div class="article-date">April 11, 2025</div>
    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Kimi Antonelli’s FP1 at the 2025 Bahrain Grand Prix was one to forget, as a water pressure issue in his Mercedes W16 limited him to just three laps, leaving him stranded in P20. The Italian prodigy, tipped as a future star, cut a frustrated figure, unable to showcase his talent in front of the Sakhir crowd. Mercedes confirmed the glitch was a one-off, but it’s a blow for Antonelli, who’s under pressure to prove himself after replacing George Russell for this session. With track temperatures exceeding 46°C, the lost track time stings even more, as he missed critical setup data for the cooler night sessions. Antonelli vowed to “bounce back” in FP2, but Mercedes will need to work fast to restore his confidence. A tough debut, but the kid’s got grit.</p>
